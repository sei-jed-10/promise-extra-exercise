// 1. Promise Foods has a method called `.readMenu`.
// Call this method and console.log the cheapest burger on the menu once the promise has been resolved.


//CODE FOR QUESTION 1 HERE




// Order Some Food
/* *************************************************************** */
// 2. For this task, you will use the method .order to order the cheapest burger on the menu.
// The order method has one argument, the name of the burger you would like to order.
// Once the promise has been resolved, console.log "Man that burger sure was tasty!".

// CODE FOR QUESTION 2 HERE



// 3. Try and use the same method to order a `quesadilla`.
//  Since Promise Burger only serves burgers, this will throw an error.
//  Make sure that your Promise can be dealt with when it is rejected.

// CODE FOR QUESTION 3 HERE



// Add A Burger To The Menu
/* *************************************************************** */

// 4. kitchen also has a method called `addToMenu`.
//  This method has one argument, which expects an object with a name, price, and description.
//  Use this method to add this burger to the menu.
//  Add a method to console.log the response once the promise is resolved!
//  Also add a method to catch an error if something goes wrong



  // CODE FOR QUESTION 4 HERE

  // 5. Validate that the new item has been added to the menu by calling `readMenu` again.
  // We only want to call `readMenu` after we get a response that is successful.
  // Remember that we can chain promises together the same way that we can chain jQuery methods.
  // db.addToMenu(newBurger)

  // 6. Let's be honest, people only go to Promise Burger when they are showing out-of-towners around.
  // You old college roommates are all visiting Atlanta and want to try out this place.
  // They already know what they want to eat!
  // Loop through each customer and use the `.order` function on each object within the array.
  // Then console.log `All Food Delivered` when ALL of the promises have been resolved.
  // This will require you to use a method we haven't covered in class.
